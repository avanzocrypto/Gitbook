# Introduction

In business, information is vital. The faster and more accurate the information, the better the outcomes. Blockchain technology offers the ideal solution for providing such data. It delivers real-time, shareable, and completely transparent information on an immutable ledger, accessible exclusively to members of a permissioned network. Blockchain enables seamless tracking of orders, payments, accounts, production, and more. Figure 1 illustrates how blockchain ensures a single source of truth for all members, providing end-to-end visibility into transactional data. This fosters trust, increases operational efficiencies, and unlocks new opportunities.

At AVANZO, we enhance blockchain's capabilities by integrating AI technology, which analyzes transactional data, identifies inefficiencies, and suggests improvements, optimizing system performance and decision-making for users.
