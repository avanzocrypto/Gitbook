**Blockchain vs. Bank Real Estate Investing: Pros & Cons**

Banks offer real estate investments through Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), but they grant investors little to no control over their funds. Bankers decide where to invest, how payments are handled, and maintain opaque transaction processes. Conversely, blockchain empowers investors with transparent, democratic control over decisions. At AVANZO, you vote on investment locations, property choices, and payment methods.

AI enhances this by analyzing voting data, recommending options aligned with investor preferences, and ensuring seamless execution of chosen strategies.
