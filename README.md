## <mark style="color:red;">**Abstract**</mark>

In the event that readers choose to participate in one of our investing pools, a new investing strategy is proposed in this article. By tying investors' investments to real estate assets, which equal the invested value for each pool, this approach will lower the risk that investors face while dealing with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. With a return provided to investors on various cryptocurrencies according to their preferences, utilizing a DAO vote, investors can rest certain that their investments are safe and the danger of capital loss is eliminated. Using a DAO vote, investors also have the option to (end) or (continue) the investment after receiving each return.
