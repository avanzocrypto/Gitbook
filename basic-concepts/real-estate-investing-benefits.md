# Real Estate investing benefits

**Appreciation**

Real estate investors profit from multiple revenue streams, including property appreciation, rental income, and property-related business ventures. Over time, property values typically increase, allowing investors to profit when selling. Additionally, rents tend to rise over time, boosting cash flow. By employing AI-driven market analysis, AVANZO can identify properties with the highest potential for appreciation, helping investors maximize their returns.

**Cash Flow**

Cash flow represents the net profit after mortgage payments and operational expenses. It is a cornerstone of real estate investing, often growing over time as equity increases and mortgages decrease. AI at AVANZO optimizes cash flow by analyzing operational costs, projecting rental income trends, and suggesting strategies to enhance property profitability.

**Inflation Hedge**

Real estate serves as a hedge against inflation due to its positive correlation with GDP growth and real estate demand. Rising rents and capital values ensure that real estate maintains the purchasing power of invested capital. By integrating AI, AVANZO forecasts inflation trends and aligns investments with properties best positioned to withstand inflationary pressures.
