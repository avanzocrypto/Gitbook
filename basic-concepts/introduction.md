# Introduction

Information is essential to business. It is best if it is received quickly and is correct. Blockchain is the best technology for delivering such information because it offers real-time, shareable, and entirely transparent data that is kept on an immutable ledger and accessible only to members of a permission network. Orders, payments, accounts, production, and many other things may all be tracked via a blockchain network. Figure "1" provides an explanation, which shows how members share a single version of the truth and can thus see all transactional data end to end, offering you more trust as well as additional efficiencies and opportunities.
