# Ownership

#### Investors Ownership Of Property

In order to verify ownership of a property after investing in real estate, a significant quantity of paperwork is required. At Avanzo, we are creating a new contractual system with NFTs that is tied to a property and will revolutionize the real estate market.

#### Contract On Blockchain

On the open internet, proving ownership of something is probably difficult, but with blockchain and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), you can truly establish your ownership using a code that is connected to your wallet, which is a representation of your contract.

#### Avanzo Contracting system leveraging NFTs

We are creating a system where NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) represent your ownership of the asset you have invested in, together with its current holding percentage.

#### Transfer Of Ownership

Holding NFT, which stands in for your contract, enables you to sell it to other investors, thus transferring ownership of your investment to them. Unique NFTs We will provide a variety of NFTs that investors may purchase, and NFTs provide you the opportunity to go on a whitelist for a special investment that is necessary to hold the NFT.
