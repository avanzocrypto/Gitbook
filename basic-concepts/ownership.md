# Ownership

#### Investors Ownership Of Property

Investing in real estate is followed by a big amount of paper works where in the end you prove ownership of a property, At Avanzo we are developing a new contracting system that will change the whole real estate industry with NFTs that is linked to a property proofing ownership of it to the investor.

#### Contract On Blockchain

Proofing ownership of something is most likely hard on the open internet but with blockchain and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), you actually can prove your ownership with a code that is linked to your wallet representing your contract.

#### Avanzo Contracting system leveraging NFTs

We are developing a system where NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) reflect the ownership of a property you are invested in showing your current holding percentage and the property you are invested in.

#### Transfer Of Ownership

Holding NFT that represents your contract gives you the ability to sell the contract to other investors where you are actually transferring ownership of an investment to another investor.

Special NFTs

We will offer different types of NFTs where investors can buy them and NFTs give you the chance to secure a whitelist entry to some special investment required to hold the NFT.
