# Execution

Our innovative smart contract provides a variety of options, making the investing process quick, simple, and safe because all transactions are public on-chain, allowing investors to select the sort of property they want to invest in through DAO voting, as well as the nation we want to invest in next, Not to add, investors, have the option to pick the type of currency on which their yearly return is given. For example, 50% of investment pools will provide tight annual returns on the $AVAN token to encourage buying, while the remaining can choose to pay returns on (BTC, ETH, BNB, etc.).

Investors can also choose whether to maintain the investment pool by voting after the annual return is given out.
