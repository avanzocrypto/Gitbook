# Crypto Market Risk Problems & Solutions

The cryptocurrency market seems to be growing in popularity every day saying that new investors joining every day with the majority of them lack understanding of the cryptocurrency space, despite that the excessive volatility some times it looks good when its positive, But when its negative hundred of thousands of people lose their investments. We will show some of the major issues in the market and how can AVANZO be a solution for them and for investors, innovating ( store of value solution)

#### Whales

By far the biggest issue in the cryptocurrency market is the excessive volatility. The prices of cryptocurrencies on exchange platforms rise and fall dramatically over a short period of time. When a tradable asset can drop by as much as 49 percent in less than 24 hours, then the volatility of the market is high. There are a number of reasons that contribute to the excessive volatility in the market but perhaps the biggest contributor is the activities of “whales”.

#### Utility

coins that are built with out any type of utility or methodologies to keep developing in hardest market situations allot of projects " die " in long bear markets due to team unable to deliver their developing plans caused by lack of fundings. $AVAN token has the utility, to simplify, $AVAN is basically used as a ticket to get to real estate investments, plus 50% of the real estate returns are going to be with $AVAN

#### Pyramid Scaling Projects

Pyramid scaling projects relays on new people joining the project and older ones make a profit (the older you are in the project the more profit you make) if new people joined the project, of course, this issue here is at some point the cycle will be longer and harder and may end up with older stakeholders dumping on new ones and cause huge losses as to how it explained in figure 3.

As we can see older investors benefit the more and the risk of newer investors getting dumped is higher than "first come first serve", which is a bad system and it cannot handle the long-term sustainability of a project. AVANZO works differently as the investors’ investments will be 100% safe as real estate and the investors will get an annual return from the real estate profits, not only that, if the investors decide to sell their real estate and get their initial investment back then that option is totally ok if the DAO gets greater than 50%.

#### Consistency

We realize that if a project relies 100% on paying off team members, marketing, or any other associated expenses with project coins only and has no cash flow, which may cause the issue that at some point a project is unable to keep paying off using its coins and there is no other source of income to keep developing or expanding the project, this issue becomes bigger when hard market days come to throw "bear market" as an example.
