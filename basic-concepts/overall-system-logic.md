# Overall System Logic

At AVANZO, we believe blockchain technology should serve real-world needs, bridging the gap between decentralized technology and everyday demands. By incorporating AI into our blockchain platform, we can predict market trends, enhance investment decisions, and maximize returns for users.

Our platform, built on Binance Smart Chain, connects investors globally, offering them full control over their investments, payment methods, and future investment decisionsâ€”capabilities not feasible with traditional systems.

Figure 2 demonstrates the system's workflow:

1. All $AVAN token holders vote on a proposal containing three investment options.
2. The proposal with the most votes is selected, and a pool is created.
3. Investors contribute funds equal to the property value.
4. Once the pool is filled, the funds are transferred to the purchasing wallet, completing the property acquisition.
5. The property generates annual returns, which are distributed as follows: 70% to investors and 30% to the corporation after deducting expenses.

AI complements this process by forecasting property performance, optimizing investment choices, and ensuring timely fund distribution.

Additionally, the DAO model allows investors to choose their payout in their preferred cryptocurrency or a stablecoin pegged to the dollar, adding flexibility and transparency.
