#### Blockchain & Bank investing pros & cons

Banks offer real estate investing through (reits), while you as an investor got no control over your own money bankers can decide what property they would invest in, decide your payment method, and transactions are not transparent to investors simply ( you need to believe what story they tell ), on the other hand, blockchain offers a wide range of investing control you can vote on which country the investment would be, chose the property to buy, chose how are you paid, even vote on selling or keeping the property ( you decide the story ) and all transactions are transparent on chain to anyone at any time.
