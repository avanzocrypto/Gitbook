# AVANZO Solutions

#### Overview

Despite the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, our first priority at "AVANZO" is to keep investors' money secure. As noted that investments must be protected by a long-term asset that serves as a "store of value." With annual returns paid to investors from the third source of income, which will cause stability to the token and help to expand the project without manipulating the tokenomics through conventional staking solutions in the market, investors will always have their investment pegged with real estate and the risk of reducing its value is low.

#### Value

Our worth as a firm is derived from the real estate we manage. As the number of properties we manage grows, so does our overall revenue. This increases our cash flow power, allowing us to continue growing, developing, and expanding even in the worst market conditions. As Figure 4 explains.
