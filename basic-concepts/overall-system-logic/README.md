# Overall System Logic

Blockchain and real-life implementation, at AVANZO we believe that blockchain technology should be implemented to execute real-life needs as we cannot split blockchain out of real-life because we simply cannot. Implementation of a system that Benefits from the technology of blockchain to connect the world and decide how they would like to control their (investments, how are they getting paid, and deciding the future of their investments), could not be done in normal investment options, at AVANZO we implement the technology of blockchain to connect different people all over the world to share investments and have full control over it by our smart contract built on (Binance Smart Chain), Building investments solution that lasts for generations controlled by the investors regardless their location, background. This couldnâ€™t be done without blockchain technology. As shown in Figure 2, which explains the flow of the system, A proposal containing three proper opportunities is offered to all $AVAN token holders for DAO voting, after picking the highest voted investing opportunity a pool will be created then investors should fill the pool equal to the property value. After the pool is filled and it gets locked, the funds will be sent to the purchasing wallet to process the buying of the chosen property, the property will be invested and the annual returns will be split as the following: 30% to the company, 70% will go to the investors after deducting associated expenses to the property. The payments for the investors will be decided by the investors themselves by DAO if they want it in a specific cryptocurrency or a stable coin tight to the dollar value.
