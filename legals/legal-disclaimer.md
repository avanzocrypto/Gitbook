This White Paper is being released by Avanzo solely to solicit opinions and comments from the general public. If and when Avanzo makes tokens (or a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) available for purchase, it will do so through formal offering procedures, which will include a disclosure statement and risk considerations.

This White Paper is subject to change and may differ substantially in its final form when formal publications are released. Any potential offering will likely be restricted to accredited investors only, particularly for those in the United States, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Nothing in this White Paper constitutes a guarantee or promise regarding the future development of Avanzo, the tokens, their utility, or their value. The objectives outlined in this document are based on current strategies and goals but remain subject to change at Avanzo’s discretion. External factors, including but not limited to market dynamics, industry conditions, and cryptocurrency-related developments, may influence the success or feasibility of these strategies.

All forecasts and forward-looking statements in this White Paper are based on Avanzo’s current assessments and assumptions about the issues addressed herein. These statements do not guarantee specific outcomes or performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties outside of Avanzo’s control.
